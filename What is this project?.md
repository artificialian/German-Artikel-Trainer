As a highschool student taking German as a foreign language, I decided to develop this website due to the lack of detailed Artikel practice resources. Unlike most platforms, my project focuses on German articles on a grammatical perspective rather than simply nouns genders. The goal of this project is to help German learners, including myself, to build a solid grammatical foundation which is crucial in terms of constructing different sentences as we continue to learn German.

Since I have little to no knowledge about web development or coding, everything except the ideas for the functions/UI was developed by AI. The basis of the code was developed using Chat GPT 4.0 on Replit, while the detailed refinements and debugging were done by Claude Sonnet 4 as I moved the basis of my project to GitHub to publish it.
